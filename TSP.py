#ðŸ”¹ Problem: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Bitmask DP
#Description

#Given n cities and distances between each pair, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

#Classic NP-hard problem

#Solved for small n using Bitmask Dynamic Programming in O(nÂ² * 2^n)

#Used in route optimization, logistics, robotics path planning


import sys

def tsp(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    dp[1][0] = 0  # start at city 0

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        for u in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << u)):
                continue
            for v in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << v):
                    continue
                dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] = min(dp[mask | (1 << v)][v], dp[mask][u] + graph[u][v])

    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    return min(dp[full_mask][i] + graph[i][0] for i in range(n))
